  <h1>About L Storm</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      L Storm was built from some heavy nights and hard lessons.
      There was a time when everything felt louder in my head than it did in real life.
      I didn’t always handle it well. I tried to ignore it.
      I tried to numb it. But avoiding it never fixed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The turning point wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a movie moment.
      It was small. It was quiet.
      It was choosing to step back instead of stepping further.
      Choosing to speak instead of staying silent.
      Choosing to reach out instead of pretending I was fine.
    </p>

    <div class="bridge">
      Not the fall — the step back.
    </div>

    <p>
      Recovery isn’t easy. It doesn’t happen overnight.
      It takes uncomfortable conversations.
      It takes patience. It takes honesty.
      It takes falling back sometimes and still deciding to keep going.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it is possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This music isn’t about pretending to be strong.
      It’s about being honest when you’re not.
      It’s about choosing tomorrow, even when today feels heavy.
      If you’re struggling, reach out to someone you trust.
      You’re not weak for needing help.
    </p>

    <p>
      One Step Down is just the beginning.

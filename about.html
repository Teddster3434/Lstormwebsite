    <h1>About L Storm</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        L Storm was built from heavy nights and hard lessons. There was a time when
        everything felt louder in my head than it did in real life. I didn’t always
        handle it well. I tried to ignore it. I tried to numb it. But avoiding it
        never fixed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The turning point wasn’t dramatic. It was small and quiet — choosing to step
        back instead of stepping further. Choosing to speak up instead of staying
        silent. Choosing to reach out instead of pretending I was fine.
      </p>

      <div class="bridge">Not the fall — the step back.</div>

      <p>
        Recovery isn’t easy, and it doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time. It takes
        patience. It takes honesty. It’s learning new habits, having uncomfortable
        conversations, and sometimes slipping back — then choosing to keep going anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal with this music is simple: make the dark feel less lonely and encourage
        people to get help if they need it. If you’re struggling, reach out to someone
        you trust. You’re not weak for needing help. You deserve tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p><strong>One Step Down</strong> is the beginning.</p>
